## What are Web Archives?

A web archive is a record of web resources. It may include HTML and images, scripts, stylesheets, as well as video, audio and other elements that web pages and web apps are made of, all in one file.

Webrecorder Player currently supports browsing web archives in the following formats:

- [WARC format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive) **(.warc, warc.gz)** â€” the most commonly used one
- [HAR format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.har) **(.har)**
- [ARC format](http://archive.org/web/researcher/ArcFileFormat.php) **(.arc, .arg.gz)**


## How do I Create Web Archives?
You can use free service [https://webrecorder.io](https://webrecorder.io) to create, view, share and save your web archives online.

To view your web archives offline, you can download them from [https://webrecorder.io](https://webrecorder.io) and use this app to browse your archives.
